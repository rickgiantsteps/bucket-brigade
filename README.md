Emulation of the analogue bucket-brigade delay. Developed with the JUCE framework with @MotAtlas for the Music Production Technologies course @ University of Milan.

A block diagram is included in the "images" folder to showcase the basic function of each knob more intuitively. The two LFOs present in the plugin's interface respectively control the L and R stereo delay lines.
